    "## Deep Learning Architectures and Encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving into the hands-on work, it’s important to first understand the key ideas behind **deep learning architectures** and **encoders**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **deep learning architecture** is like the **blueprint of a factory**. It defines how the network is organized, how data flows through different components, and how raw inputs are transformed into meaningful outputs. Just as a factory blueprint specifies where materials enter, how they are processed, and where finished products come out, a neural network architecture lays out the arrangement of layers (neurons) that progressively extract and refine patterns from data—for example, detecting cats in images or translating between languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this blueprint, an **encoder** functions as a **specialized assembly line**. Its role is to take messy raw materials (input data) and refine them into a compact, standardized representation that is easier for the rest of the system to work with. Some architectures also include a **decoder** assembly line, which reconstructs or generates the final output from the encoder’s compressed representation—for example, assembling a finished car from engine parts and panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model architecture = the factory blueprint (overall design and flow)**\n",
    "* **Encoder = the preprocessing line (condenses raw inputs into useful parts)**\n",
    "* **Decoder = the finishing line (turns encoded parts into a final product)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Different blueprints are suited for different tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feedforward Neural Networks**: simple, one-directional flow of data.\n",
    "* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: specialized for images, capturing spatial patterns like edges and textures.\n",
    "* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: designed for sequences, such as speech or time series.\n",
    "* **Transformers**: powerful models for language and beyond, using attention mechanisms (e.g., ChatGPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does an Encoder Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **encoder** is the part of a neural network that takes an input (like an image or a sentence) and compresses it into a smaller, meaningful form called a **feature representation** or **embedding**. This process keeps the essential information while filtering out noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sentence *“I love pizza”* might be converted by an encoder into a vector of numbers that still reflects its meaning, but in a way that is easier for a computer to analyze and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoders appear in many contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Autoencoders**: learn to compress and reconstruct data.\n",
    "* **Transformer Encoders**: such as BERT, used for language understanding.\n",
    "* **Encoder–Decoder Models**: such as translation systems, where the encoder reads one language and the decoder generates another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoders and Architectures in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "The [pytorch segmentation models library](https://github.com/qubvel-org/segmentation_models.pytorch) provides a wide range of pre-trained models for semantic segmentation. It separates **architectures** (the blueprint) from **encoders** (the feature extractors):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Architectures**: `unet`, `unetplusplus`, `deeplabv3`, `deeplabv3plus`, `fpn`, `pspnet`, `linknet`, `manet`.\n",
    "* **Encoders**: `resnet34`, `resnet50`, `efficientnet-b0`, `mobilenet_v2`, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **GeoAI** package builds on this library, offering a convenient wrapper so you can easily train your own segmentation models with a variety of architectures and encoders."

    "## Surface water mapping with non-georeferenced satellite imagery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Surface water mapping** is one of the most important applications of GeoAI, as water resources are critical for ecosystem health, agriculture, urban planning, and climate monitoring. In this first demonstration, we'll work with **non-georeferenced satellite imagery** in standard image formats (JPG/PNG), which is often how satellite imagery is initially distributed or stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why start with non-georeferenced imagery?**\n",
    "- Many datasets and online sources provide satellite imagery without embedded geographic coordinates\n",
    "- It demonstrates the core computer vision aspects of GeoAI before adding geospatial complexity  \n",
    "- The techniques learned here can be applied to any imagery, regardless of coordinate system\n",
    "- It's often faster to iterate and experiment with standard image formats\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use **semantic segmentation**, a deep learning technique that classifies every pixel in an image. Unlike object detection (which draws bounding boxes), semantic segmentation provides precise pixel-level predictions, making it ideal for mapping natural features like water bodies that have irregular shapes.\n",

    "- **ResNet34** is a 34-layer Residual Network that serves as the feature extraction backbone\n",
    "- **Residual connections** allow training of very deep networks without vanishing gradient problems\n",
    "- Balances model complexity with computational efficiency (deeper than ResNet18, more efficient than ResNet50)\n",
    "- Well-suited for satellite imagery feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-trained weights: ImageNet**\n",
    "- **Transfer learning** from ImageNet provides a strong starting point for feature extraction\n",
    "- ImageNet-trained models have learned to recognize edges, textures, and patterns relevant to natural imagery\n",
    "- Significantly reduces training time and improves performance, especially with limited training data\n",
    "- The encoder starts with knowledge of general image features, then specializes for water detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key training parameters:**\n",
    "- `num_channels=3`: RGB satellite imagery (red, green, blue bands)\n",
    "- `num_classes=2`: Binary classification (background vs. water)\n",
    "- `batch_size=32`: Process 32 images simultaneously for efficient GPU utilization\n",
    "- `num_epochs=3`: Training iterations (limited for demo; real-world would use 20-50+ epochs)\n",
    "- `learning_rate=0.001`: Controls optimization step size\n",

    "   - **Definition**: Area of overlap / Area of union between prediction and ground truth\n",
    "   - **Range**: 0.0 (no overlap) to 1.0 (perfect overlap)\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: 0.69 IoU means ~69% accurate pixel-level water detection\n",
    "   - **Industry standard**: IoU > 0.7 is generally considered good performance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dice (F-1) Score**: Alternative segmentation metric, closely related to IoU\n",
    "   - **Definition**: 2 × (Area of overlap) / (Total pixels in both prediction and ground truth)\n",
    "   - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0, similar to IoU but slightly more lenient\n",
    "   - **Relationship**: Dice = 2×IoU / (1+IoU)\n",
