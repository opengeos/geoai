    "# Moondream Vision Language Model - Sliding Window for Large Images\n",
    "\n",
    "[![image](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/opengeos/geoai/blob/main/docs/examples/moondream_sliding_window.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the sliding window methods for processing large images with [Moondream](https://moondream.ai) vision language model. The sliding window approach divides large images into smaller overlapping tiles for more effective processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Sliding Window?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better Performance on Large Images**: Moondream VLM processes smaller image tiles more effectively than very large images\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory requirements by processing one tile at a time\n",
    "- **Better Detail Recognition**: Smaller tiles allow the model to focus on finer details\n",
    "- **Overlap Handling**: Overlapping tiles prevent missing objects at tile boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Sliding Window Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `detect_sliding_window()` - Object detection with bounding boxes\n",
    "2. `point_sliding_window()` - Point detection for object locations\n",
    "3. `query_sliding_window()` - Visual question answering\n",
    "4. `caption_sliding_window()` - Image captioning"
