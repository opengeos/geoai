about=This plugin provides AI-powered geospatial analysis tools:

    Moondream Vision-Language Model:
    - Caption: Generate descriptions of geospatial imagery
    - Query: Ask questions about images using natural language
    - Detect: Detect and locate objects with bounding boxes
    - Point: Locate specific objects with point markers

    Semantic Segmentation:
    - Train custom segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, FPN, etc.)
    - Run inference on raster imagery
    - Export results as vector or raster data

    SamGeo segmentation:
    - Segment objects using text prompts (e.g., "tree", "building", "road")
    - Segment using point prompts (foreground/background) or box prompts drawn on the map
    - Process multiple points interactively or from vector files/layers
    - Save results as raster (GeoTIFF) or vector (GeoPackage, Shapefile) with optional regularization

    Requires the geoai-py Python package and PyTorch with CUDA support for optimal performance.
